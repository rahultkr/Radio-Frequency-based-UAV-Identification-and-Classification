# Radio-Frequency-based-UAV-Identification-and-Classification
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are becoming more and more common, require RF-based UAV detection and defense systems. A branch of machine learning called deep learning has demonstrated considerable promise for enhancing the precision and dependability of these systems. A strategy based on machine learning is suggested in this work for the identification and categorization of radio frequency signals from drones.
The DroneDetectV2 data set is used as the data source. We specifically concentrate on deploying deep learning methods for RF signal-based UAV detection and classification. Additionally, we go over the difficulties in developing deep-learning models for UAV detection and provide potential solutions. In this study, we analyzed the categorization outcomes for two examples with and without taking drone flight modes into account. The findings of this work show that deep learning may considerably improve the precision and dependability of RF-based UAV detection and defense systems, making them a powerful instrument for safeguarding vital infrastructure and ensuring the safety of the general population.
